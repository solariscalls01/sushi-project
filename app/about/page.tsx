            Our journey began as a simple dream fueled by a shared love for sushi and the desire to bring authentic Japanese flavors to our community. 
            As more customers discovered us and word of mouth spread, we realized that we were not
            just serving sushiâ€”we were building a place where people could gather, share stories, and savor something truly special.
